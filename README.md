# Lotto-maddness-

A simple lotto simulator created in Java using the swing GUI library.

# Current completed features -

* All GUI components have been added to the JFrame
* Event listener for clearing Numbers and Winners JTextFields complete
* Added basic event listener to collect random numbers for each lotto draw
* Added functionality to check if the drawings match the user's chosen numbers
* The application will now track how many matches the user got. Currently supports matches of 3,4,5 and 6.


# TO-DO -

* Expand play event listener to not allow duplicate numbers on ALL JTextFields and not just the last box
* Add field to show how many matches the current draw has (Currently using the year's field)
* Possibly replace years for matches.
